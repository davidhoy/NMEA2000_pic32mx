# NMEA2000_pic32mx

This library provides a PIC32MX driver for the NMEA2000 library.

See https://github.com/ttlappalainen/NMEA2000.


## Usage

This library requires the MPLAB Harmony v1 Framework. Make sure you have it installed.


    #include <NMEA2000.h>
    #include <N2kMessages.h>
    #include <NMEA2000_pic32mx.h>

    tNMEA2000_pic32mx NMEA2000;

    void setup() {
      NMEA2000.open();
    }

    void loop() {
    }

See the [NMEA2000](https://github.com/ttlappalainen/NMEA2000) for more examples. They are all compatible with this library.

## Hardware

This driver only works with the PIC32MX1/2/5 boards, or derivatives.

You will need a CAN transceiver like the MCP2551 (for a list of other tested CAN controllers, refer to the [FlexCAN library README](https://github.com/teachop/FlexCAN_Library).
